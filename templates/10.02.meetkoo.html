      </div>

      <p>Born on <strong>September 1, 1997</strong>, in <strong>Busan</strong>, South Korea, Jeon Jungkook was a quiet and curious child. He graduated from Seoul’s School of  Performing Arts in 2017. He received his college degree in  Broadcasting and Entertainment in 2022. He grew up with a deep love for drawing, gaming, and sports — never quite imagining he’d one day stand on the world’s biggest stages.</p>

        “Respect, Understanding, Consideration. A person should always have these three.” — JK
      </div>
      <p>In 2011, he auditioned for <strong>Superstar K</strong> at just 13 years old. Though he didn’t make it to the finals, his talent caught the eye of multiple entertainment companies but, he chose Big Hit because of RM. Jungkook trained hard — undergoing dance training in LA, mastering vocals, and growing through every stage of practice. When BTS debuted in 2013, he was just 15 but, his energy, voice, and sharp gaze made him unforgettable. From a shy boy who barely spoke to the group’s “Golden Maknae,” Jungkook’s transformation was as inspiring as it was beautiful. Every stage, every note, every step — he gave his all.

    <p>Debuting with BTS on June 12, 2013, Jungkook quickly established himself as a pillar of the group. As the main vocalist and one of the lead dancers, he brings exceptional range, fluid technique, and emotional nuance to every song. From the tenderness of <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Spring Day</strong> to the explosive energy of <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Mic Drop</strong>, his vocals consistently elevate BTS's music.</p> 
    <p>Jungkook has played a key creative role in several BTS tracks. He co-produced the beloved fan song <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Magic Shop</strong>,” drawing inspiration from the group's relationship with ARMY and infusing it with warmth and sincerity. He also contributed to directing the <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Life Goes On</strong> music video, capturing intimate, reflective moments of the members during the pandemic, that showed his growing artistic vision.</p> 
    <p>His voice is often central in BTS’s harmonies and high-note ad-libs, including his emotional climaxes of Spring Day and The Truth Untold and some unforgettable moments in <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Fake Love</strong>, <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Butter</strong>, and <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Boy With Luv</strong>. In the track <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Stay</strong>, with RM and Jin from the “BE“ album, Jungkook co-wrote and performed a vibrant, electronic-pop piece that offered hope and connection during isolation, showcasing his songwriting range within a group setting.</p> 
    <p>Jungkook has also left his mark behind the scenes. He co-produced and co-wrote the moving ballad <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Your Eyes Tell</strong>, originally meant for his solo work but later chosen as a Japanese OST and included in BTS’s album “Map of the Soul: 7 – The Journey.” The track, praised for its cinematic quality and lyrical depth, reflects his growing influence as a songwriter.</p>

Whether he’s executing intricate choreography or improvising during encore stages, Jungkook’s presence commands attention, an anchor in BTS’s world-class performances.

    <p>While thriving as a member of BTS, Jungkook has also built a distinct identity as a solo artist within the group’s discography. His first solo track with BTS was <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Begin</strong> from the “WINGS“ album (2016), a heartfelt ode to his hyungs that reflected his gratitude and emotional maturity despite his young age.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he released <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Euphoria</strong>, a bright, soaring track that became a fan favorite and was featured in the BTS short film “Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself 起 Wonder“ before officially appearing on “Love Yourself: Answer“. With <strong style="color: #00ffff;">My Time</strong> from “Map of the Soul: 7 (2020)”, Jungkook explored the cost of growing up in the spotlight, blending R&B rhythms with autobiographical lyrics that resonated deeply with listeners.</p>
    <p>Jungkook also independently released <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Still With You</strong> on SoundCloud during BTS Festa 2020, a jazzy ballad full of longing and warmth, showcasing his self-produced artistry.  In 2021, he released <strong style="color: #00ffff;">My You</strong>, a bilingual fan-dedicated track that he wrote, composed, and produced himself.

In 2022, he collaborated with SUGA on the haunting track <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Stay Alive</strong> for the ”7Fates: Chakho” soundtrack. The song became the first Korean OST to enter the UK Official Singles Chart and earned him his first solo entry on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
    <p>Beyond BTS albums, his global solo presence soared with Charlie Puth’s <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Left and Right</strong> (2022), followed by <strong style="color: #00ffff;">Dreamers</strong>, the official anthem of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where Jungkook became the first Korean artist to perform at the tournament’s opening ceremony.

He noticed Bam in a corner, unable to feed, and decided to take him in. This compassionate decision reflects Jungkook’s deep care for animals and his desire to provide Bam with a loving home. Additionally, Jungkook has been praised for not docking Bam’s tail or cropping his ears, practices often associated with Dobermans.
